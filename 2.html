<h2>SAFETY AND SAFETY EQUIPMENT</h2>
<p>No matter how small the job, safety must be practiced at all times. A tool may be efficient, essential, time-saving or even convenient; but it is also dangerous. When using any hand tool you must use it correctly, following the methods prescribed in this manual. You must also be alert for any conditions that might endanger yourself or fellow workers. Take the time necessary to acquaint yourself with the safety guidelines in this chapter. Remember, you are the most important part of safety procedures.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, there are other good tool habits which will help you perform your work more efficiently as well as safely.</p>

<h3>TOOL HABITS</h3>
<p>“A place for everything and everything in its place” is just common sense. You cannot do an efficient, fast repair job if you have to stop and look around for each tool that you need. The following rules, if applied, will make your job easier.</p>

<h4>Keep Each Tool in Its Proper Storage Place</h4>
<figure data-id="2-1" class="float-right">Improper tool storage</figure>
<p>A tool is useless if you cannot find it (Figure 2-1). If you return each tool to its proper place, you will know where it is when you need it.</p>

<h4>Keep Your Tools in Good Condition</h4>
<p>Keep them free of rust, nicks, burrs, and breaks.</p>

<h4>Keep Your Tool Set Complete</h4>
<p>When have been issued a toolbox, make sure each tool remains inside the box when not in use. When the toolbox is not actually at the worksite, it should be locked and stored in a designated area.</p>

<div class="alert alert-note">An inventory list is kept in every toolbox to be checked before and after each job or maintenance action, to ensure that all tools are available to do your work and to ensure that they are accounted for after you have completed your work.</div>


<h4>Use Each Tool Only on the Job for Which It Was Designed</h4>
<figure data-id="2-2" class="float-right">Keep tools within reach.</figure>
<p>If you use the wrong tool to make an adjustment, the result will probably be unsatisfactory. For example, if you use a socket wrench that is too big, you will round off the corners of the wrench or nut. If this rounded wrench or nut is not replaced immediately, the safety of your equipment may be endangered in an emergency.</p>

<h4>Keep Your Tools Within Easy Reach and Where They Cannot Fall on the Floor or on Machinery</h4>
<p>Avoid placing tools anywhere above machinery (Figure 2-2) or electrical apparatus. Serious damage will result if the tool falls into the machinery after the equipment is turned on or running.</p>

<h4>Never Use Damaged Tools</h4>
<p>Notify your supervisor of broken or damaged tools. A battered screwdriver may slip and spoil the screw slot or cause painful injury to the user. A gage stretched out of shape will result in inaccurate measurements.</p>

<div class="alert alert-note">Return broken tools to section chief.</div>

<p>Remember, a worker’s efficiency is often a direct result of the condition of the tools being used. Workers are often judged by the manner in which they handle and care for their tools. You should care for hand tools the same way you care for personal property. Always keep hand tools clean and free from dirt, grease, and foreign matter. After use, return tools promptly to their proper places in the tool box. Improve your own efficiency by organizing your tools so that those used most frequently can be reached easily without sorting through the entire contents of the box. Avoid accumulating unnecessary items.</p>

<h3>TOOL BOXES</h3>
<p>Tool boxes (Figures 2-3 through 2-8) are used for storing tools. They are usually made of steel but sometimes of wood or plastic. Portable tool boxes are used for carrying and storing a variety of hand tools. Both special and common tools, such as mechanic’s, electrician, and carpentry tools can be found in tool boxes. Chest-type tool boxes generally contain larger tools, such as specialized automotive tools or machinist’s tools, requiring a more permanent location.</p>
<p>Some larger tool boxes are mounted on wheels so they can move easily from place to place. Tool bags are usually made of canvas. Like the boxes, they are available in a variety of sizes and serve similar functions.</p>

<h3>POWER TOOL SAFETY RULES</h3>
<p>Safety is a very important factor in the use of power tools and cannot be overemphasized. By observing the following safety guidelines, you can ensure maximum benefits from the tools you use and reduce to a minimum the chances of serious injury.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Never operate any power equipment unless you are completely familiar with its controls and features.</li>
	<li>Inspect all portable power tools before using them. See that they are clean and in good condition.</li>
	<li>Make sure there is plenty of light in the work area. Never work with power tools in dark areas where you cannot see clearly.</li>
	<li>Before connecting a power tool to a power source, be sure the tool switch is in the “OFF” position.</li>
	<li>When operating a power tool, give it your FULL and UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.</li>
	<li>DO NOT DISTRACT or IN ANY WAY DISTURB another person while they are operating a power tool.</li>
	<li>Never try to clear a jammed power tool until it is disconnected from the power source.</li>
	<li>After using a power tool, turn off the power, disconnect the power source, wait for all movement of the tool to stop, and then remove all waste and scraps from the work area. Store the tool in its proper place.</li>
	<li>Never plug the power cord of a portable electric tool into a power source before making sure that the source has the correct voltage and type of current called for on the nameplate of the tool.</li>
	<li>Do not allow power cords to come in contact with sharp objects, oil, grease, hot surfaces, or chemicals, or to kink.</li>
	<li>Never use a damaged cord. Replace it immediately.</li>
	<li>Check electrical cables and cords frequently for overheating. Use only approved extension cords, if needed.</li>
	<li>See that all cables and cords are positioned carefully so they do not become tripping hazards.</li>
	<li>Treat electricity with respect. If water is present in the area of electrical tool operation, be extremely cautious and, if necessary, disconnect the power tool.</li>
</ul>

<h3>SAFETY EQUIPMENT</h3>
<p>Safety equipment is for you. It will protect you from injury and may possibly save your life. Some of the more common types of safety equipment for your personal protection follow.</p>

<h4>Safety Shoes</h4>
<figure data-id="2-9" class="float-right">Safety shoes</figure>
<p>Safety shoes (Figure 2-9) protect feet and prevent injury or loss of toes. Some safety shoes are designed to limit damage to your toes from falling objects. A steel plate is placed in the toe area of such shoes so that your toes are not crushed if an object falls on them. Other safety shoes are designed for use where danger from sparking could cause an explosion. Such danger is minimized by elimination of all metallic nails and eyelets and the use of soles which do not cause static electricity.</p>






<h4>Eye Protection</h4>
<figure data-id="2-10" data-frames="a,b,c" class="float-right">Eye protection</figure>
<p>Proper eye protection (Figure 2-10, frames 1 through 3) is of the highest importance for all personnel. Eye protection is necessary because of hazards caused by infrared and ultraviolet radiation, or by flying objects such as sparks, globules of molten metal, or chipped concrete and wood, etc. These hazards are always present during welding, cutting, soldering, chipping, grinding, and a variety of other operations. It is absolutely necessary for you to use eye protection devices such as helmets, handshields, and goggles during eye-hazard operations.</p>
<p>Appropriate use of goggles will limit eye hazards. Some goggles have plastic windows which resist shattering upon impact. Others are designed to limit harmful infrared and ultraviolet radiation from arcs or flames by the use of appropriate filter lenses.</p>
<p>Remember, eye damage can be extremely painful. Protect your eyes.</p>

<h4>Helmets</h4>
<figure data-id="2-11" class="float-right">Protective helmet</figure>
<p>Protective helmets (Figure 2-11), also known as hard hats, come in a variety of shapes. They may be made of tough polyethylene or polycarbonate, one of the toughest hat materials yet developed. When falling objects strike the hats, the shock-absorbing suspension capabilities minimize injuries.</p>
<p>Regular hard hats must be insulated so that personnel may be protected from accidental head contacts with electrical circuits and equipment at comparatively low voltages (less than 2,200 volts).</p>
<p>Electrical workers requiring head protection necessary to perform their duties or to suit the working environment must wear insulating safety helmets or all-purpose protective helmets that must be capable of withstanding 20,000 volt minimum proof-tests.</p>

<h4>Gloves</h4>
<p>Use gloves whenever you are required to handle rough, scaly, or splintery objects. Special flameproof gloves (Figure 2-12) are designed for gas and electric welding in order to limit danger and damage from sparks and other hot, flying objects. Personnel working with electricity are usually required to wear insulating rubber gloves (Figure 2-13). Be sure to follow all regulations prescribed for the use of gloves. Gloves must not be worn around rotating machinery unless sharp or rough material is being handled. If such is the case, extreme care should be used to prevent the gloves from being caught in the machinery.</p>

<figure data-id="2-13" class="float-right">Insulated gloves</figure>





<h4>Safety Belts and Safety Straps</h4>
<figure data-id="2-14" class="float-right">Safety belt and safety strap</figure>
<p>The safety belt and safety strap (Figure 2-14) are a must when working in high places. The safety belt, strapped around the waist, contains pockets for small tools. It also has two D-rings used to attach the safety strap. The safety strap is a nylon-reinforced leather belt that is placed around the item to be climbed. It is then attached to the two D-rings on the safety belt. Detailed use of the safety belt and safety strap is described in chapter 49 of this manual.</p>



<h4>Ear Protection</h4>
<figure data-id="2-15" class="float-right">Hearing protection</figure>

<p>Proper hearing protection (Figure 2-15) is a must when working with or around certain types of power tools. Some tools are capable of producing dangerously high noise levels which, if ignored, can result in serious hearing loss or injury. Use hearing protection regularly.</p>
